# LaunchDeck
## Diary-like app used for taking notes which is launched upon login, letting you feel like a medieval scribe. 
Automatically creates new note page on each day, serving as a personal diary. Created with WPF engine in Visual Studio Community Edition in MVVM pattern.

Main intention for creating such app was to automatically save every note, so that the users doesn't have to save it manually like in Notepad. Uses Entity Framework Core connecting with SQLite DB to save each note character on the running application.
